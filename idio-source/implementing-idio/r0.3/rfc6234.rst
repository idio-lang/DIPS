.. aside::

   SHA256 and friends to you and me.

RFC6234_, US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF),
provides not only a definition of these Secure Hash Algorithms but,
conveniently, a :lname:`C` reference implementation.

Following in the footsteps of many, :lname:`Idio` takes this code
verbatim and adds some :lname:`Idio`-specific wrappers.

We now have the ability to generate and verify that messages and files
have been communicated without interference.

We'll use this to verify that the pre-compiled object files have the
contents we expect.
