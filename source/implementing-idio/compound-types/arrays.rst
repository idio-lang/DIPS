.. sidebox:: I had to look this up.

Traditionally, :lname:`Scheme`\ s support the notion of a fixed length
*vector* of values and *arrays* of multiple dimensions (quite possibly
implemented using vectors).

To throw fuel on the fire of potential confusion, :ref-author:`Alex
Stepanov` the author of the :lname:`C++` :ref-title:`Standard Template
Library` was looking for a name to distinguish his new "vector" type
from the builtin arrays so, noting that both :lname:`Scheme` and
:lname:`Common Lisp` used "vector" for a similar type, chose, uh,
``vector`` (read more `here
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/581426/why-is-a-c-vector-called-a-vector>`_).

He has subsequently admitted it is a mistake because his "vector" has
nothing to do with a Mathematical vector which is a fixed length
ordered sequence of values in a Set.

So, not only a naming issue but is potentially compounded by by users
coming from different backgrounds where overloaded names mean
something else.

In :lname:`Idio` I wanted "arrays" (whatever they are but `I'll know
one when I see one
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it>`_) and in
particular I wanted them to be dynamic in size so I could use them for
*stacks* for the VM (which presume a single dimension --
:socrates:`wait, multi-dimensional stacks...`).  As a stack they will
have to take on any old value and, as I had no pressing need, all
arrays are one dimensional.

I fancy that if we want multi-dimensional arrays then we should be
calling them matrices.  I suppose then, a single dimensional matrix is
equivalent to an array and a zero dimensional matrix is a (scalar)
value.

I read about :lname:`Lua`'s *sparse arrays* which seemed like a neat
trick though I couldn't see any particular immediate use for them.
They are implemented, of course, as part regular array, being `yea
<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yea>`_ big *\*waves hands\**, and part
hash table.

What *is* interesting about that idea, going back to our shell arrays,
or, rather, :lname:`Bash` arrays, which are slightly magical
themselves or, numerically idiosyncratic, depending on your view, is
that they support gaps.  In the first instance we can remove entries
and the missing entries sort-of disappear:

.. code-block:: bash

   # create an array of three elements and remove the middle one
   % a=( 1 2 3 )
   % unset a[1]

   # what's in our array now?
   % echo ${a[*]}
   1 3
   % echo ${#a[*]}
   2

   # specifically:
   % echo ${a[1]}
   % echo ${a[2]}
   3


Operations on the array as a whole -- notably reporting the number of
elements in the array -- indicate the reduced number yet the deleted
element is "still there."

That counting result is slightly perverse.  I could understand that an
enumeration of an array with deleted elements might result in a
shortened list:

.. code-block:: bash

   r=( "${a[@]}" )

Giving me a true, two element list in ``r``.  But that the *count* of
the elements in ``a`` is short.  That's weird.  We *know* the last
indexable element is 2 (starting from 0) but the array length is 2.

I wonder if that's why the :samp:`$\\{!{name}[*]}` form of parameter
expansion -- to return the keys of the array -- was created?

Another, related, trick is that I can add another *non-contiguous*
element and the same whole-array view is maintained.  The missing
elements are ignored for whole-array operations:

.. code-block:: bash

   % a[4]=4
   % echo ${#a[*]}
   3
   % echo ${a[3]}

This got me thinking.  I use arrays quite a lot in the shell -- it
*is* the only data structure, after all -- and I have twirled and
twisted using the same "missing math" tricks which *I* know work,
because I've being doing it for years, but does anyone else know?  Is
it behaviour that a regular programming person is going to
:term:`grok`?

I don't think so.

That second variation has another, more pernicious possibility.

.. code-block:: bash

   % a[1234567890]=1
   % $echo ${!a[*]}
   0 2 4 1234567890


:lname:`Bash` is happy, obviously, with that but it nominally requires
that *we* create a 10\ :sup:`10` element array because our arrays are,
naÃ¯vely, actual contiguous blocks.

Does that lead us back towards the :lname:`Lua` (and, evidently,
:lname:`Bash`) sense of sparse arrays?  I don't want to go there.  It
looks like it's solving a problem I'm not sure exists in regular
programming fare.  One that a user can solve themselves in
:lname:`Idio`-land with a structure of *stuff*.

However, I think we can allow the growth of arrays by pushing an
element on the end (like a stack) and I've allowed for the
:lname:`Perl`-ish ``unshift`` to push an element on the front of an
array.  But I don't like the arbitrary index mechanism.

.. sidebox:: And not a mathematical vector.

I suppose, in that sense, :lname:`Idio` arrays function much like a
mildly extended :lname:`Scheme` vector, a *vector+*.

Implementation
==============

How *big* an array?

C99 suggests that sizes should be ``size_t`` so we could create an
array with ``SIZE_MAX`` elements.  Even on non-segmented
architectures, such a memory allocation will almost certainly fail
but, sticking to principles, someone might want to create a
just-over-half-of-memory, :samp:`2**({n}-1) + 1`, element array.  (If
only to annoy the developers.)

The reason it will fail is that every Idio array element is a pointer,
ie 4 or 8 bytes, therefore we can't physically allocate nor address
either :samp:`2**32 * 4` bytes or :samp:`2**64 * 8` bytes just for the
array as those are 4 and 8 times larger than addressable memory.  So,
in practice, we're limited to arrays of length :samp:`2**30` or
:samp:`2**61` -- with no room for any other data (including the code
doing the allocating)!

As a real-world example, on an OpenSolaris 4GB/32bit machine:

.. code-block:: idio
		
   make-array ((expt 2 29) - 1)

was successful.  :samp:`2**30 - 1` was not.

However, we accomodate negative array indices, eg. the nominal,
:samp:`array[-{i}]`, which we take to mean the :samp:`{i}`\ :sup:`th`
last index.  The means using a *signed type* for array indexing even
if we won't ever actually use :samp:`a[-{i}]` -- as we'll convert it
into :samp:`a[{size} - {i}]`.

So, the type we use must be ``ptrdiff_t`` and therefore the largest
positive index is ``PTRDIFF_MAX``.  We'll call it a "idio array index
type" or ``idio_ai_t``.

.. code-block:: c
   :caption: gc.h

   typedef ptrdiff_t idio_ai_t;

   #define IDIO_ARRAY_FLAG_NONE		0

   struct idio_array_s {
       struct idio_s *grey;
       idio_ai_t asize;
       idio_ai_t usize;
       struct idio_s *dv;
       struct idio_s* *ae;
   };

   typedef struct idio_array_s idio_array_t;

   #define IDIO_ARRAY_GREY(A)	((A)->u.array->grey)
   #define IDIO_ARRAY_ASIZE(A)	((A)->u.array->asize)
   #define IDIO_ARRAY_USIZE(A)	((A)->u.array->usize)
   #define IDIO_ARRAY_DV(A)	((A)->u.array->dv)
   #define IDIO_ARRAY_AE(A,i)	((A)->u.array->ae[i])
   #define IDIO_ARRAY_FLAGS(A)	((A)->tflags)

where we have:

* ``asize`` being the allocated size

* ``usize`` being the used size, or user-visible size -- technically
  the index of the last in-use index plus one

* ``dv`` is the default value

* ``ae`` are the array elements

The default value is used to reset an element when the index is
"deleted."  Clearly, it isn't really deleted so this is the effective
action.

Depending on how an array is created it will have an allocated size
but the initial used size can vary.  If the array is created from
:lname:`C` then it will most likely have an initial used size of zero.
The only way to *add* elements is to push (or unshift) them onto the
array.

If the array is created from :lname:`Idio` primitives then the used
size will match the allocation size (which may be the number of
arguments passed).

If the array is grown, by push or unshift, then at some point the used
size will reach the allocated size.  At this point the array will be
doubled in size.

Reading
-------

A useful reader format for static arrays uses the tradition square
brackets syntax common to many programming languages.

``#[ ... ]``

Writing
-------

Arrays will use the ``#[ ... ]`` reader format.

Operations
==========

:samp:`array? {value}`

      is :samp:`{value}` an array

:samp:`array [{args}]`

      construct an array from the arguments :samp:`{args}`

      The initial used size will be the length of :samp:`{args}`.

:samp:`make-array {size} [{default}]`

      construct an array of :samp:`{size}` elements setting each to
      the default value :samp:`{default}` if supplied otherwise ``#f``

:samp:`copy-array {array} [{depth} [{extra}]]`

      return a copy array of :samp:`{array}`

      :samp:`{depth}` can be the *symbol*:

      * ``shallow`` meaning each element in the new array is simply a
        reference to the element in the original array

      * ``deep`` meaning that each element in the new array is a
        (recursive) copy of the element in the original array

      :samp:`{extra}` indicates by how many more elements the array's
      *allocation* should be grown -- presumably in preparation for
      some impending use.  This avoids the risk of the new array
      doubling in size if the growth is known in advance.  The initial
      in-use size will be the same size as the original array
      :samp:`{array}`.

:samp:`array-fill! {array} {fill}`

      set every currently in-use element of array :samp:`{array}` to
      :samp:`{fill}`

:samp:`array-length {array}`

      return the number of in-use elements of array :samp:`{array}`

      Technically this returns the index of the highest in-use element
      plus one.

:samp:`array-ref {array} {index}`

      return the value at index :samp:`{index}` of array
      :samp:`{array}`

      :samp:`{index}` must be an integer and within the bounds of the
      used elements of the array.

      :samp:`{index}` can be negative in which case the calculated
      index is :samp:`{array-length} + {index}`.

:samp:`array-set! {array} {index} {value}`

      set the value at index :samp:`{index}` of array :samp:`{array}`
      to :samp:`{value}`

      :samp:`{index}` must be an integer and within the bounds of the
      used elements of the array.

      :samp:`{index}` can be negative in which case the calculated
      index is :samp:`{array-length} + {index}`.

.. _`array-push`:

:samp:`array-push! {array} {value}`

      add value :samp:`{value}` onto the *end* of array
      :samp:`{array}`

      This is a means to grow the size of the array.

.. _`array-pop`:

:samp:`array-pop! {array}`

      return the value :samp:`{value}` at the *end* of array
      :samp:`{array}` and decrease the size of the array by one.

      This is a means to shrink the in-use size of the array.  An
      array's *allocated* size is not current reduced.

.. _`array-unshift`:

:samp:`array-unshift! {array} {value}`

      add value :samp:`{value}` onto the *start* of array
      :samp:`{array}` -- all the other values are shifted up by one
      index.

      This is a means to grow the size of the array.

.. _`array-shift`:

:samp:`array-shift! {array}`

      return the value :samp:`{value}` at the *start* of array
      :samp:`{array}` and decrease the size of the array by one.

      This is a means to shrink the in-use size of the array.  An
      array's *allocated* size is not current reduced.

.. _array->list:

:samp:`array->list {array}`

      return the elements of array :samp:`{array}` as a list.

      See also :ref:`list->array <list->array>`.
